		In a <a href="/2017/01/30/partial-application-is-dependency-injection">previous article</a>, you can read why Dependency Injection and (strict) functional programming are mutually exclusive. Dependency Injection makes everything impure, and if nothing is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure</a>, then it's hardly functional. In <a href="/2017/02/02/dependency-rejection">Dependency rejection</a>, you can see how you can often separate impure and pure code into an <a href="/2020/03/02/impureim-sandwich">impure/pure/impure sandwich</a>.

	<p>
		The impure/pure/impure sandwich architecture works well in scenarios with limited interaction. Some data arrives at the boundary of the system, the system responds, and that's it. That, however, describes a significant fraction of all software running in the world today.
	</p>
	<p>
		Any HTTP-based application (web site, REST API, most SOAP services) fits the description: an HTTP request arrives, and the server responds with an HTTP response. In a well-designed and well-running system, you should return the response within seconds, if not faster. Everything the software needs in order to run to completion is either part of the request, or part of the application state. You may need to query a database to gather more data based on the incoming request, but you can still gather most data from impure sources, pass it all to your pure core implementation, get the pure values back and return the response.
	</p>
	<p>
		Likewise, asynchronous message-based systems, such as pub/sub, Pipes and Filters, Actor-based systems, 'SOA done right', CQRS/Event Sourcing, and so on, are based on short-lived, stateless interactions. Similar to HTTP-based applications, there's often (persisted) application state, but once a message arrives at a message handler, the software should process it as quickly as possible. Again, it can read extra (impure) data from a database, pass everything to a pure function, and finally do something impure with the return value.
	</p>
	<p>
		Common for all such systems is that while they can handle large volumes of data, they do so as the result of a multitude of parallel, distinct, and isolated micro-operations.

		There is, however, another category of software. We could call it 'interactive software'. As the name implies, this includes everything with a user interface, but can also be a long-running batch job, or, as you've <a href="/2017/06/27/pure-times">already seen</a>, time-sensitive software.
	</p>
	<p>
		For such software, the impure/pure/impure sandwich architecture is no longer possible. Just think of a UI-based program, like an email client. You compose and send an email, receive a response, then compose a reply, and so on. Every send and receive is impure, as is all the user interface rendering. What happens next depends on what happened before, and everything that happens in the real world is impure.

	<p>
		Have we finally identified the limitations of functional programming?
	</p>

		Hardly. In this series of articles, I'm going to show you how to model pure interactions:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="/2017/07/11/hello-pure-command-line-interaction">Hello, pure command-line interaction</a></li>
			<li><a href="/2017/07/17/a-pure-command-line-wizard">A pure command-line wizard</a></li>
			<li><a href="/2017/07/24/combining-free-monads-in-haskell">Combining free monads in Haskell</a></li>
			<li><a href="/2017/07/31/combining-free-monads-in-f">Combining free monads in F#</a></li>
			<li><a href="/2017/08/07/f-free-monad-recipe">F# free monad recipe</a></li>
		</ul>
		You can skip the Haskell article if you only want to read the F# articles.
	</p>
	<p>
		This series of articles gives you a comprehensive walkthrough of pure interactions and free monads in F#. For a motivating example, see <a href="/2017/06/27/pure-times">Pure times</a>, which presents a more realistic example that, on the other hand, doesn't go to the same level of detail.

	<p>
		The solution to the problem of continuous impure interactions is to model them as a instructions in a (domain-specific) Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and then using an impure interpreter for the pure AST. You can model the AST as a (free) monad in order to make the required syntax nice.
